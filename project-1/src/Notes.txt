    - CSS in JS Libaries ( Styled Components )

RJS-22 Component LifeCycle Methods 
    - Mounting 
        When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM 
    - Updating
        When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
    - Unmounting
        When a component is being removed from the DOM
    - Error Handling
        When there is an error during rendering, in a Lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component

RJS-23 Mounting LifeCycle Methods
    1. constructor( props ) 
        - A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created
        - Intiallizing state, Binding the event handlers 
        - Do not cause side effects. ex: HTTP requests
        - super( props ), Directly overwrite this.state
    2. static getDerivedStateFromProps( props, state )
        - When the state of the component depends on changes in props over time 
        - Set the state
        - Do not cause side effects. ex: HTTP requests
    3. render ()
        - Only required method in class component
        - Read props & state and return JSX
        - Do not change state or interact with DOM or make AJAX calls
        - Children components Lifecycle methods are also executed
    4. ComponentDidMount() 
        - Invoked immediately after a component and all its Children components have been rendered to the DOM.
        - Cause side effects. ex: Interact with the DOM or peform any AJAX calls to load data

RJS-24 Component Updating Lifecycle Methods
    ~~
    1. static getDerivedStateFromProps( props, state )
        - Method is called everytime a component is re-rendered
        - Set the state
        - Do not cause side effects. ex: HTTP requests
    2. shouldComponetUpdate( nextProps, nextState )
        - Dictates if the component should re-render or not 
        - Performance optimization 
        - Do not cause side effects. ex: HTTP requests, Calling the setStateMethod
    3. render ()
        - Only required method in class component
        - Read props & state and return JSX
        - Do not change state or interact with DOM or make AJAX calls
    4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate( prevProps, prevState )
        - Called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are to be reflected in the DOM 
        - Capture some information from the DOM 
        - Method will either return null or return a value. Returned value will be passed as the third parameter to the next method. 
    5. componentDidUpdate( prevProps, prevState, snapshot )
        - Called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles
        - Cause side effects 

    ~~ Unmounting Phase Method
    ComponentWillMount ()
        - Method is Invoked immediately before a component is Unmounted and destroyed 
        - Cancelling any network requests, removing event handlers, Cancelling any subscriptions and also invalidating timers.
        - Don't call the setState() Method

    ~~ Error Handling Phase Method
    static getDerivedStateFromError( error )
                    X
    ComponentDidCatch( error, info )
        - When there is an error either during rendering, in a Lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.


RJS-26 Pure Component 

    Regular Component
        - A Regular component does not implement the shouldComponetUpdate method. it always returns true by default
    Pure Component
        - A Pure component on the other hand implements shouldComponetUpdate with a shallow props and state comparison


    Shallow comparison (SC)
        Primitive Types 
            - a (SC) b returns true if a and b have the same value and are of the same type 
        Complex Types
            - a (SC) b returns true if a and b reference the exact same object

        `
        var a = [1,2,3]
        var b = [1,2,3]
        var c = a; 

        var ab_eq = ( a === b ) // false
        var ac_eq = ( a === c ) // true
        `

    ~ Pure Component
        A pure Component implements shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow prop and state comparison 

        SC of prevState with curState 
        SC of prevProps with curProps

             Re-render Component


    - Helps us by preventing unnecessary renders can give us a performance boost in certain scenarios.

    - It is a good idea to ensure that all the children components are also pure to avoid unexpected behaviour.

    - Never mutate the state. Always return a new object that reflects the new state.
